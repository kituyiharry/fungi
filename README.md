## Fungi (Fun-ctional G-raph Implementation)

This is an adjacency set based graph implementation with algorithms written in
a functional style. It supports various path, flow, matching and scc algorithms
with more to be added in the future. Some data structures will also be added to
support the graph (Heap (done), LC-tree, UnionFind...etc).
